## What is this?
Welcome to Musical Spork, my working repository of notes. I'm currently in an intensive liberal arts course, and as an aid to myself and my classmates, I decided to make some of my notes public.

**Disclaimer**: Be aware that this is very much a work in progress. You may find broken links or empty notes.

Also, every page on this site is incomplete, because I will be adding to it and restructuring as I learn. So, don't expect it to stay the same.

Also, I'm not perfect, and my notes aren't either. I'm sure there are typos & even factual errors in these pages. If you do notice something, feel free to email me at musical-spork@jameshall.xyz.

Finally, special thanks to notenote.link for providing the website code & Obsidian for helping me organize my notes.
