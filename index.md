# Musical Spork
Welcome to Musical Spork, my working repository of notes. I'm currently in an intensive liberal arts course at [Gutenberg College](https://gutenberg.edu), and as an aid to myself and my classmates, I decided to make some of my notes public.

**Disclaimer**: Be aware that this is very much a work in progress. You may find broken links or empty notes. 

Also, every page on this site is incomplete, because I will be adding to it and restructuring as I learn. So, don't expect it to stay the same. 

Also, I'm not perfect, and my notes aren't either. I'm sure there are typos & even factual errors in these pages. If you do notice something, feel free to email me at [musical-spork@jameshall.xyz](mailto:musical-spork@jameshall.xyz). 

With that said, let's talk about how I organized the site. It's primarily wiki-style, so there's no central Table of Contents. Instead, I have scattered pages that are loosely pulled together using Maps Of Contents (MOCs). 

Here are a few MOCs to start out with.
- [[MOC - Modern Philosophers]]
- [[MOC - Monarchs of England]]
- [[MOC - European Wars after the Middle Ages]]
Finally, special thanks to [notenote.link](https://github.com/Maxence-L/notenote.link) for providing the website code & [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for helping me organize my notes.
