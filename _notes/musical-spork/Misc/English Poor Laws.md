# English Poor Laws

Catholic church had structures for taking care of poor; when Protestants took over, they ended many of those; led to the Poor Laws

**Note**: w/ each act, the size of the system of relief & the cost of the system increased;
	Also, w/ each act the administration of the system of relief become more centralized, less locally controlled

**1601 Elizabethan Poor Law**
	- Church of England no longer taking care of poor
	- Types of poor: able bodied, idle, impotent
	- Law was based on local parish where everyone is known (case by case basis)
	- Relief was money/food or person sent to almshouse, orphanage, workhouse
	- vast majority was money/food

- a compulsory poor rate to be levied on each parish
- the creation of 'Overseers' of relief
- the 'setting the poor on work'
- the collection of a poor relief rate from property owners

Problems: Inconsistent application led to travelling beggars who would go to the most generous parishes.


**1662 Settlement Act**
- can't move around easily. Parish only supported locals living in parish
- farmers would hire outside of parish. Firing them would not add costs to support poor
- landowners reduced amount of housing to reduce cost to support poor
- workers could not easily move to find jobs elsewhere leading to a labor imbalance; labor shortages & labor surplusses


**1723 Knatchbull**
- parishes could combine forces in administration of relief so farmers could not exploit borders
- transition to workhouses. You had to work to get relief. No work, no relief.
- workhouses were inefficient & unkind to workers


**1765 Gilbert Act**
- parishes created poor houses for the infirm b/c workhouse didn't cover them
- land owners & employers receive allowances for poor people they hire to increase wages; incentive to hire poor
- brought the wealthy into the system directly & expanded relief


**Wars w/ France**
- imports drop due to war & prices for bread rise
- unrest of poor
- additional war tax on top of poor tax


**1795 Speenhamland System**
- not a law, but broadly adopted
- every laborer would have his wage supplemented by parish to be "livable"
	- supplement depended on family size & price of bread
	- employers could lower wages & allow relief workers to still survive
	- employers would pay same low wages to people who did not take relief out of principle
	- wages fell forcing people either to starve or join subsidies
	- led to hardship for poor & expansion of the costs for wealthy
	- other taxes from war were compounding problems
	[[Malthus]] wrote during this system, and was prob influential in leading to amendment
	
**1834 Poor Law Amendment Act**
- nationalizes the relief
- establish efficient local administrative units
- make regulations for the general administration of relief
- no more wage/money/food supplements
- workhouses & poorhouses only source of relief (not uniformly applied)
