# Industrial Revolution
Changes intended to shift from *subsistence* to *surplus*
	- Up til now, people had *subsistence* living.
		- I grow enough food to survive
Also shift from *agrarian* to *manufacturing*
	- animals begin to be bred to be more efficient
	- a machine can now do the work of 1000 people, and is only overseen by 2-3
	
### Timeline of the Revolution
**First Wave** 1760s-1810s
	- revolution in food & textile production
	- shipbuilding
**Second Wave** - 8110s-1860s
	- more metal mechanization; factories
	
	
### Backstory
- In 1575, most all available work & money went to obtain food
- Basic unit of production was the household
- populations had recovered to pre-black death levels
	- so increase in demand, which drove tech development
	- supply of goods short
- most powerful institutions in cities: guilds
	- controlled # of workers
	- ensured high costs by limiting production
	- but rural not regulated by them
- the "putting out" system - textile
	- merchant provides materials & equipment to rural workers (unregulated by guilds)

### Textiles
- started in Great Britain ([[Industrial Revolution#Why Did England Industrialize First\|why?]])
- wool industry worked hard to limit cotton production (naturally)
	- they made laws that prohibited cotton cloth imports
	- so instead, merchants imported raw cotton & processed it locally
- **Challenges**
	- production quality (English hands larger than Asian hands)
	- Production speed
		- increased by the fly shuttle (enabled wider cloth)
		- then John Wyatt invented an automated spinning machine
- **Processes**
	- Carding - make fibers parallel
	- Roving - draw out & twist
	- Spinning - further twist into yarn
	- Weaving - yarn woven into cloth
	- Dying - add color

### 4 Basic Changes
1) improved agriculture (steel plow, improved horse collar, better seeds)
2) organization of production
3) commoners got more political clout (govs moving democratic)
4) demographic shifts to urgan


### Development of Factory
- built water-mill machines; limited possible locations 
- but then steam enabled a factory to be anywhere
- **Impact**
	- workers go to the factory to work, not work out of their homes
	- production became more urban (people moved to cities, b/c there's a lot of opportunity)
		- but then there was a ton of cheap labor, so slums developed


### Why Did England Industrialize First?
- developed the patent (incentive for inventors)
- ready supplies of iron & coal
- timber resources were declining
- modernized agriculture (enough food for people to live in cities)
- developed lots of markets
- first nation to build all-weather roads (very important)
