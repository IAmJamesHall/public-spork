# Rome

## Theology
	- ritualistic
	- polytheism that absorbs other religions
	- after Jesus, Constantine legalizes Christianity, which mixes w/ neoplatonism
	- no longer can Rome absorb other religions, now it has to change them to comply
## Anthology
	- duty to state (HONOR!) (Horatii bros)
	- transactional rel w/ gods
	- die honorably
## Politics
	- kings -> republic -> Caesars -> 5 good dictators -> Nero -> Goths invade -> West falls in 5th c -> East falls in 1400s
	- very state-centered
	- proactive paranoia (conquering neighbors/absorbing)
	- early church combines offices/politics + theology
## Philosophy
	- therapeutic / stoicism
	- combined parts of other philosophies
	- no epic contributions of their own

	- slaves (conquered peoples)
	- tributes (fr. conquered)
