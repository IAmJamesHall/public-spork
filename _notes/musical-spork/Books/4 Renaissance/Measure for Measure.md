# Measure for Measure
Author: [[Shakespeare]]

The Duke, noticing that he had not been executing the law well enough, temporarily gave over his power to his trusted man Angelo, telling him that he was going on a long trip. In reality, the Duke went undercover in his own land as a friar. Angelo immediately began prosecuting the law, bringing a man Claudio to jail for adultery. As punishment, Claudio was to be hung. Claudio's sister Isabella went to Angelo and asked him for a pardon, which Angelo agreed to grant, if Isabella would sleep with him. Isabella refused. The Duke overheard, and suggested a plan to Isabella. Unknown to Angelo, Angelo's formerly sworn fiance went to him that night pretending to be Isabella. However, Angelo still ordered Claudio executed. The Duke stayed the execution and publicly brought justice to Angelo, who was as guilty as Claudio. Thus Claudio was saved and honor was kept.
