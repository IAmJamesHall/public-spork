### Summary
Edwards wrote of "religious affections," which are like emotions,  but are deeper and more profound. They could be described as the deepest inclination of one's soul. He was trying to explain the relationship between these affections and true Christianity. Unlike others of his day, he argued that affections can be expressed in legitimate religion, but affections are not the only indicator of whether one is saved or not. Then he talked about what other indicators there are of true religion, with Christian practice and a holy life being chief among them. He also explained the difference between the work that God can do to an unbeliever and what he can do to a believer: namely, that he can only work *on* a non-believer, but he can work *in* a believer.
