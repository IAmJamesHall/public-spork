Written by [[Luther]]
### Class Notes
- Christian is lord of all & subject to all
- maybe he's not saying that all good works ever done by believers are damnable sins
	- (view in context of a Luther-era hypocritical church-goer)
- freedom from what?
	- freedom from working for salvation, works (impossible to fulfill commandments)
	- the law
	- political freedom (NO)
	- sin?
- body vs soul
	- works make body submit to inner man, and help him improve
	- works do not make him holier
	- is inner man good, or bad, or mix?
	- can a believer make bad works? (70)



### Summary
Luther begins his treatise with an introductory letter to the Pope, hoping to convince him that Luther was not his enemy. Then Luther began his main subject: the place of faith and works. He argued that there are two parts of a Christian: the inner and the outer, the spirit and the body. The most important thing for a Christian to do is to become firmly rooted in the Word of God and to have faith in Him. This is done by the spirit, and it is what saves a person. No work of the body can save anyone. And yet, works are not unimportant. While faith will bring a man's soul into harmony with God, his body will still be in rebellion against God. Thus, works are useful for training the body to obey God. Works should be done to serve God and others, but not to try to benefit oneself.
