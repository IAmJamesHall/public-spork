# What is Enlightenment?
Author: [[Kant]]

### Class Discussion
##### What are his ends?
- Are we after **enlightenment** or freedom?
- We want freedom so that we can pursue enlightenment
- **enlightenment**: man's release from his self-incurred tutelage; thinking for yourself
	- it's ok to learn from others, but I have to think through what they're giving me; not just accepting it
	- *what is the end of enlightenment?* continual progress
		- there is no "the good" that enlightenment aims at; but man's use of individual reason will always lead in a "good direction"
		- ie. it doesn't matter what you believe; as long as you came to that conclusion by yourself
		- i.e. it doesn't matter whether you're moving toward truth or falsehood, as long as you're moving
		- is there no ultimate [[Truth]]?
			- or maybe ultimate truth is unattainable; we can only get closer to it
- **guardians** of action are beneficial; but not of thought
##### What are the impediments to his ends?
##### What are the means to overcome those impediments?

##### What does Kant mean by [[Reason]]?
- can this reason actually arrive at a conclusion?


### Critique of the Enlightenment
- it didn't work; using our reason led us to WWI & WWII

### Summary
Kant described man's tutelage as being his dependance on another person for the use of his reason.  Enlightenment is when a man is released from this bondage and has the ability and competance to think for himself. There are certain times and situations where a man ought to follow another: a priest leading his flock in worship, for instance, has agreed to lead them in a certain way. But when he is acting as a scholar and not as a priest, he has every right to doubt and consider his religion. We should not and cannot impose upon ourselves or others the harsh burden of having everything decided for him. Every man has the right to think for himself. He must still obey the authority (such as the prince) over him, but ideally he can always think for himself and voice his opinion to others.
