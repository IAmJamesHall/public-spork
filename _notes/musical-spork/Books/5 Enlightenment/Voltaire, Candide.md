By [[Voltaire]]

### Questions

### Summary
Candide lived a happy life in a nice estate under the tutelage of the fine philosopher Pangloss, until he was kicked out for loving the daughter of the house, Cunegonde. Then he was kidnapped and forced to fight in the army. During the war, Cunegonde and her brother were killed, according to Pangloss, who escaped. However, Pangloss was soon burned as a heretic and shortly afterward Candide was reunited with the not-dead Cunegonde. Other adventures included having Cunegonde taken by the governor of Buenos Aires, Candide killing Cunegonde’s brother and almost getting killed by cannibals himself, then discovering the best place in the world, El Dorado. However, he was not happy there because Cunegonde wasn’t there. So, he went to find her. Eventually, he did find her, and her brother (who he didn’t actually kill) and Pangloss (who apparently wasn’t actually burned) and Candide married Cunegonde.
