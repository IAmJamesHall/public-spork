# What is Enlightenment?
Author: [[Kant]]

### Summary
Kant described man's tutelage as being his dependance on another person for the use of his reason.  Enlightenment is when a man is released from this bondage and has the ability and competance to think for himself. There are certain times and situations where a man ought to follow another: a priest leading his flock in worship, for instance, has agreed to lead them in a certain way. But when he is acting as a scholar and not as a priest, he has every right to doubt and consider his religion. We should not and cannot impose upon ourselves or others the harsh burden of having everything decided for him. Every man has the right to think for himself. He must still obey the authority (such as the prince) over him, but ideally he can always think for himself and voice his opinion to others.
