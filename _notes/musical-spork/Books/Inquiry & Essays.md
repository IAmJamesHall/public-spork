# Inquiry & Essays
Author: Thomas [[Reid]]

![[Reid#Philosophy]]

- what does he think of previous philosophers?
	- they didn't use common sense
	- they gave us the ideas/words to use to talk about philosophy
	- they asked questions that didn't need to be answered
		- giving answers we already know but with explanations that don't make sense



### Book Notes
- sensation may be presented to the mind in 3 ways
	- it may be sensed (implies present existence)
	- it may be remembered (implies past existence)
	- it may be thought of/imagined (does not imply existence; otherwise called *Simple Apprehension*) 
- thinks that remembered sensations are immediate objects of his imagination, and not the idea of the sensation
- first principles don't fall to [[Reason]], but to common sense
- **principles of common sense**: "certain principles...which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them." (pg 20)
- the idea that we have a being separate from our thoughts is assumed by everyone; and cannot be proven by reasoning or experience, so does not need to be proven.
- qualities & substances exist outside of experience
- **suggestion**: *what is it?*
- Senses
	- **smell** is a sensation that is not dependent on a mind
		- smelling is an act of the mind, and not a quality of it
			- smell is a quality of a rose
			- but smelling is an action of a body
			- "ability to smell" is a quality of a mind (/body?)
		- there really is something in the flower that causes me to smell it; it's not just in my mind
		- mind searches for a "cause" (not in the strict sense, but just something that continually coincides with the phenomenon; i.e. searching for the flower that causes a scent)
			- **experience** is what makes these connections
		- sometimes signifies a sensation (dependent on a mind), but generally signifies a quality which is independent of the mind
	- **hearing** 
		- noblest use of hearing is [[Language]]
	- **touch** - complex, has many sensations; connections b/t these sensations and the ideas they form cannot be gotten through experience or reason
		- "heat & cold" -> like smell, can signify a sensation or a quality
		- "hardness & softness" -> quality that signifies the cohesion of a body's parts
		- "natural signs" -> 3 types
			- 1) established by nature, but discovered by experience
			- 2) established by nature, and discoverd to us by a natural principle
			- 3) never conceived by us before, but the natural signs instantly conjures it up to us (??)
	- extension, figure, & motion cannot be ideas of sensations (so what are they, [[Hume]]?)
- [[Reason]] can't prove the existence of impressions and ideas, any more than it can prove that of minds and bodies
	- even [[Descartes]] took it for granted that he thought


### Summary
Reid talks about sensation, and the different ways that it can be presented to the mind: through the senses; through the memory, and through the thoughts or imagination. He emphasizes the necessity of common sense, and how the first principles are not discoverable through reason, but only through this common sense. Also, there is a principle alled suggestion that enables sensations to connect ideas. For instance, when I smell something, there is a quality outside of me and not dependent on me that causes the scent. The quality suggests to me the concept that I then store in my memory. Reid then talks about hearing, and about the noblest purpose of hearing, namely language and communication. Finally, Reid discusses the different sensations of touch, and the ideas of extension, figure, and motion. He continually reemphasized that reason cannot prove the existence of anything.
