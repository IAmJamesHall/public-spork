# Nichomachean Ethics
## Summary
### Books I, II, III
Aristotle begins by saying that everything humans do is for the purpose of one good or another, some of which are higher or better than others. The science or study of what is good is called politics. That good is determined to be happiness, and he concludes that for happiness to be the final good, it must be self-sufficient and an end in itself. Aristotle goes on to talk about moral virtue, that it is a state of character and that it must be a mean of the excess and the inferior forms of itself. Then he determines the difference between voluntariness and choice. Namely, that choice is based on previous deliberation, while something voluntary can be done with no previous thought, but it is still controlled by the person. He concludes that virtue and vice are chosen, voluntary acts.


### Books VI, X
Aristotle begins to talk about intellectual virtue, and he seems to say that intellectual virtue is correct reason. He briefly talks about the purpose of contemplation and calculation, then goes on to enumerate the chief intellectual virtues: scientific knowledge, art, intuitive reason, and philosophic wisdom. He continues to talk about intellectual virtues related to conduct, namely goodness, understanding, and judgement.

Next, he discusses pleasure and happiness. He asks whether pleasure is wholly good or bad, and explains why pleasure is not continuous: because pleasure is based on activity, and activity must sometimes give way to rest. He talks about happiness, saying that it is not amusement, but rather, right action. Throughout he says that the really pleasant thing is what the good man considers to be pleasant. He argues that the best, happiest life is the contemplative one, for perfect happiness is a contemplative activity. Finally, he discusses the means of making people good and happy through legislation.
