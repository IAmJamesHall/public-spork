# Plutarch, Alcibiades
### Summary
From childhood, Alcibiades had a strong sense of his own self-importance and had his own way with most things. Though surrounded by flatters, he was attracted to Socrates, and learned much from him. He was very clever and was not above using deceit to benefit himself and Athens. This was evidenced by his dealings with the Laced√¶monians. He was made the general of the navy, but his enemies contrived a legal case against him, and Athens exiled him. He became influential and was made a general in Sparta, Athens enemy, until he fell into trouble there as well, and had to move to Persia, the Greeks' mutual enemy. In desperate need, the Athenians recalled him from exile to be their general again, and after some brilliant victories, his enemies had him replaced as general, so that he would not become more popular with the people. He was killed by his political enemies.
