# Phaedrus
Phaedrus and Socrates meet leaving the city, so they strike up a conversation. Phaedrus had just come from a discussion with Lysias, so naturally they begin to discuss Lysias's thoughts. Phaedrus read a speech of Lysias's; the speech argues that it is better to associate with those who do not love you, rather than those who do. That is because the former relationship is based on temporary passion, and the latter on permanent friendship. He also argues that love is a form of madness. Socrates eventually disagrees, saying that while love is madness, madness is not always a bad thing, and it is sometimes a great good. Then he goes into a discussion about the soul and beauty, and seems to espouse the idea that souls are immortal and live in different mortal bodies at different times. At the end, they break off into discussion about speeches, and the futility of writing.
