# Agamemnon
A watchman sees a signal flare, and goes to tell the queen of Troy's downfall, the news that they have been waiting for. Troy's downfall means that her husband, Agamemnon, will be returning. The queen Clytaemestra announces to the town that Troy had fallen. Soon, a ship arrives from Troy, and a herald disembarks, bringing the news that Troy indeed did fall, but that Menelaus, the king, perished in the attempt. Shortly afterward, Agamemnon, who was Menelaus's brother, comes ashore, bringing a girl, Cassandra, that he took from Troy. Agamemnon and Clytaemestra go into the house, and Cassandra pronounces many woes upon the house and city of Agamemnon. Then she goes into the house and Agamemnon's screams come out. It is discovered that Clytaemestra killed Agamemnon and Cassandra in revenge for him sacrificing their daughter to the gods and has now taken a new lover, even as the city is in uproar.
