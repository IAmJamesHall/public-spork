# Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War

## Summary
### Pericles' Funeral Oration
Thucydides began by describing the funeral procedures of the Athenians. Then, he wrote down Pericles' oration at one of these funerals. Pericles paid honor to their ancestors and praised the heartiness, the courage, and the loyalty of the Athenians. He spoke well of the men who had fallen; he emphasized the glory that those who die honorably receive. 

### Plague
The next summer after this funeral, the plague broke out. Thucydides says that he caught it, and explained what it was like. He tries to explain the suffering, but says that words cannot adequately describe it. Then, as he says, the Athenians gave up their noble desire to live and die honorably. Knowing that they would likely die dishonorably on a sickbed, they gave themselves up to pleasures. Both the godly and the ungodly died alike, so they had no fear of rule or god. Thankfully, the plague did not seem to spread far; its effect was most strongly felt in Athens.

### Revolutions (p236)
The Greek states were in an uproar. Civil war started first in Corcyra, with the democrats attempting to overthrow the oligarchs. Then, the enemy Peloponnesians showed up in their ships. The Corcyraeans put off to fight in their unorganized ships, with the Athenians following behind. The Corcyraean ships were no match for the Peloponnesians', so the Athenians took over the fighting. In the end, the Peloponnesians fled, and the Corcyraean democrats butchered the oligarchs.
	
### Melian Dialogue (p400)
Athens was also engaged in Melos, which previously was a neutral state. Athens sent a delegation to the Melians, with the hopes of making peace without war. The Athenians' primary arguments were that they were stronger, and the Melians had no better hope than to surrender on good terms. The Melians refused the offer, and were immediately besieged. The siege ended when Melos was forced to unconditionally surrender and all the inhabitants were killed or sold as slaves.
