# Oedipus Rex
The people of Thebes suffered under a heavy plague, so Oedipus sent to the oracle to ask what should be done. The oracle instructed them to solve the murder of the previous king—Laius—and Oedipus pronounced several curses on the murderer and asked for help in finding him. At the advice of his co-ruler, he sent for a prophet, who unwillingly accused the king of the murder. Then Oedipus accused his co-ruler of trying to depose him. Finally, the truth came out that Oedipus had been foretold to kill his own father, and sleep with his own mother. Eventually, they discovered that while he had been raised in a foreign country, he was actually the son of Laius, and had unwittingly killed him before taking his throne and wife. Oedipus put out his own eyes at this, and begged to be sent away as judgement.
