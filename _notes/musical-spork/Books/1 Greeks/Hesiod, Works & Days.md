# Hesiod, Works & Days
### Summary
Zeus is the greatest, and the strongest. He decides whether men succeed or fail, whether they are known or unknown.  Before, when man has tried to better himself by tricking Zeus, Zeus has always repaid him. The men of old were great and did heroic deeds, and even though they sometimes erred, they received honor. This current race, though, receives harsh treatment from the gods. But man can still affect his fate by his actions. Man should perform his work well and strive to please the gods, especially Zeus, to have the best chance of doing well. Those who are just in their actions instead of doing violence will succeed. But do not over-trust or over-mistrust. Both are harmful. Use common sense and take precautions in all things. Pay due attention to the gods, and do not offend them. This is the way to gain wealth and succeed in life.
