# Meno
The dialogue starts with Meno asking Socrates whether virtue can be taught or whether it can come naturally. Socrates replied that he did not even know what virtue was, much less whether it could be taught. When Meno tries to define virtue, he fails, instead giving instances of particular virtues. Then, he proposes "ability to govern" as virtue, but Socrates strikes that down. Finally, Meno convinces Socrates to jump to the point and tackle whether virtue can be taught. Socrates responds that nothing is taught; everything is remembered from a previous experience. He proves this using an uneducated slave who could understand geometry. During the conversation, Anytus, a wealthy Athenian, showed up and he and Socrates had a brief conversation, ending with an angry Anytus warning Socrates against his bothersome meddling. In the end, Socrates concluded that virtue is divinely given and cannot be taught.
