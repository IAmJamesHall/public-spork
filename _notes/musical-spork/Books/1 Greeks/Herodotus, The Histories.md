[Britannica summary](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herodotus-Greek-historian)

### Summary
Herodotus begins by debunking Egypt's claim that it was the oldest civilization by telling the reader about an experiment that one of the kings did that disproved it. He then goes on to describe Egypt's geography, and discuss different theories and stories regarding the source of the Nile and its peculiarities. Moving on, he talks about Egyptian religious practices, and the worship of their gods. Later, he discusses the different kinds of mummification, and how Egyptians treat both wild and tame animals. Then he goes on to discuss the kings of Egypt and their adventures. Prophecy played a large part in many of the stories, and when an oracle decreed something, they generally took it as fact. These annals are filled with fascinating stories of intrigue, passions, and achievements. Throughout, he bares many secrets that few knew previously, but that he found through discussion with Egyptians, and others.
