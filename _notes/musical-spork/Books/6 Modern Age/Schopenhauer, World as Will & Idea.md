# Schopenhauer, World as Will & Idea

### Class Notes
- world is idea (these ideas drawn from combining [[Hume]] and [[Kant]])
	- mind takes in sensations, then actively perceives them
	- only aware of the world as it directly affects us
	- [[Newton]] would say that the world is only matter, but Schopenhauer is saying that your mind is putting the form on the matter, and that mental idea is 
	- the subject is noumenal, it is the thing in itself
	- I am a subject with a will, and I know a few things about myself
		- so I know some things about the noumenal
	- the world is the sum total of my imperical experiences
- will
	- man's will is disguised by his knowledge
	- but all of nature has a will for life
	- will is always toward an end/goal (though everything is not going towards a singular goal)
	- the will is what connects the individual to his body
		- your self-conscious helps you realize that you are not just an object, but also a subject
		- the will is the relationship b/t subject & object
	- the will is what makes things happen
		- so a rock has a will that makes it fall
		- a plant has a will that makes it grow
	- will is the primal force that drives all of history
- subject & object
	- a subject is a thing with a will

### Summary
Schopenhauer describes how we know things and analyzes the subject and the object. A person is a subject, and a subject can have knowledge of many objects, though not the other way around. Specifically, the objects do not have any essence, apart from the perception of the subject. He does not deny that the objects have matter, but rather that they do not have essence. In addition, a person's knowledge of outside objects is gathered through knowledge of the person's body as an object. The person is not aware of external objects. Rather, he is aware of sensations from his body. Thus, the body is termed "immediate object." After discussing the world as idea, he went on to discuss will and reason, and how they interact with intuitive experience. Every force in nature is a sort of will, and they all work against each other to display the forces that we see.
