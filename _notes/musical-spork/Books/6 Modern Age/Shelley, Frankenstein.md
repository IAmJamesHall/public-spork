# Frankenstein
### Summary
Frankenstein's tale was told using letters from an explorer to his sister. Frankenstein grew up in a happy family. He went away to be educated, and while there, threw himself into the study of science. Eventually, he discovered the secret of life and was determined to animate a body. This he succeeded in doing, but as soon as he had done it, he loathed his creation and fled from it. His monster grew in the ways of men by observing a cottage family, until he grew to hate men by their rejection of him. He began killing those closest to Frankenstein, in order to torture him. At one point, the monster offered to go away forever if only Frankenstein would construct him a mate. After deliberation, Frankenstein refused, so the monster killed Frankenstein's bride. From then on, Frankenstein pursued the monster until his death, at which point the monster also gave up his life.
