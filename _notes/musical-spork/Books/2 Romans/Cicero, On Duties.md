# Cicero, On Duties
### Summary
Cicero begins by admonishing his son to pursue philosophy before introducing the main topic of his writing: whether to choose the apparent right or the apparently advantageous. Using the various philosophies then common, Cicero concludes that the advantageous and the right can never conflict. This is because what is right is to live consistently with nature, and living consistently with nature will always be most advantageous. Then he goes on to examine this principle across a wide variety of examples, including ones where the right is contestable or the wrong is only a wrong to oneself. In each chase, he concludes that the best and most advantageous action is the one in accordance with and builds up the community. He also covers cases in business, law, and politics, telling stories of each where a decision had to be made. And in each, according to Cicero, the most advantageous decision was the moral one.
