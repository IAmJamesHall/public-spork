# Plutarch, Romulus
### Summary
Plutarch begins by discussing the different stories that were told about the founding of Rome, eventually landing on the one about Romulus and Remus. While there are many variations, it seems plausible that the brothers were abandoned as babies, but saved by wild animals until a shepherd found them and brought them up as his own. When they were grown, the brothers were bold in all they did. They wanted to build a city, but there was a disagreement among them; Romulus ended up killing Remus and building the city his own way. After it was done, he peopled it with fugitives and any who would come. Romulus went on many daring exploits, including seizing wives for his people from the nearby Sabines. Romulus continued his brave acts for a while, defeating many enemies and being loved much by the people. However, in his later years, he became soft and arrogant, and died mysteriously, some say treacherously at the hand of the senate.
