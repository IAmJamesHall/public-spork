# Plutarch, Fabius
### Summary
Early, Fabius had the reputation of being a slow, insensible, submissive man, but when he was tried, his true character was revealed as being prudent, careful, and constant. He was given dictatorship over Rome to protect them against the pillaging Hannibal, yet when he got into the field, his careful and deliberate actions were interpreted as fear and timidity. Only Hannibal recognized the brilliant strategy behind Fabius's movements. He was often ridiculed and spoken ill of, but when the other, more rash generals had fallen, the people came back to Fabius's constancy. When the battle was at its worst, he showed no fear, but rather inspired the people's confidence in the gods. The only time he seemed to act out of jealousy or spite came near the end of his life when he encouraged the people not to send Scipio into Carthage to attack Hannibal. Nevertheless when Fabius died, Rome honored him as a father.
