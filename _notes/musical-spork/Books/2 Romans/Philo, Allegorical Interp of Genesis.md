# Philo, Allegorical Interp of Genesis
### Summary
Philo's allegorical interpretation of Genesis relies heavily on symbolic language. Going verse by verse through the text, Philo informs the reader what each word means and how it should be interpreted. Only in one place does he clearly explain why his interpretation is superior to a straightforward one, and that place comes on the first page. He says that it is foolish to think that the earth was made in 6 days, because the very concept of "days" is dependent on the stars and planets, and therefore, time had no meanining until the creation happened. He then goes into a section on numbers, showing how 6 and 7 are important symbolically. Among other things, he says that the rivers that Moses describes represent 4 virtues, and that in the beginning, God made two men: the more heavenly "moulded" one who had the stamp of the image of God on him, and the earthly "man whom God made" whose composition was of clay.
