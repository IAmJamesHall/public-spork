# Plutarch, Alexander the Great
### Summary
Alexander was the son of Philip, the King of Macedon. He was a very eager and ambitious boy, once entertaining a foreign ambassador in his father's absence. He was bold, and quickly won the favor of the people of the kingdom, and they considered him their king, even while his father was still alive. He was at the head of many daring expeditions, and his men took courage from his being their leader. He made alliance with the Greeks and dominated the Persians. In battles, he often relied on cunning to bring about a victory.  He showed great generosity to his friends, and also to the enemy captives. Though, once, when provoked to anger, he he ran one of his friends through with a spear. He explored into the east as far as his men were willing, conquering as he went. He died, not in battle, but from a sickness or possibly a poison.
