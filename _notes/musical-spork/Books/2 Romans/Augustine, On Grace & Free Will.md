# Augustine, On Grace & Free Will
### Summary
This treatise focused on the apparent conflict between grace and free will, showing that without grace, we could do no good deeds. In fact, when we do perform good deeds, we do them through the grace of God. Augustine gives the example of Paul running his race, but God giving him victory. God's grace is absolutely necessary. Yet at the same time, man's free will is also important and is shown when man makes a choice between good and evil. God does not make any man do evil. Thus, both grace and free will ought to be understood together. Augustine stresses that grace is not given as a reward or because of previous good deeds. Rather, God gives grace to the undeserving, and because of that grace they can do good. A man is chosen, and only because he is chosen can he do good.
