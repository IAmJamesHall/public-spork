# Essay on the Principle of Population
Written by [[Malthus]]

### Discussion Notes
- What is the nature of man?
	- to eat & reproduce (pg 12)
	- very mechanicalistic
- What would it mean for man to be perfect?
- utopia is impossible
	- problem w/ society is not man's nature; it's a a mathematical prob of food production/population
	- men can voluntarily control their reproduction (economics, or selfish reasons)
		- is this selfishness or participating in society
- people used to feel the obligation to marry & have children
	- having children was the most important thing in Bible times
- [[English Poor Laws]] led to people staying poor
	- > "The poor laws of England tend to **depress the general condition of the poor** in these two ways. Their first obvious tendency is to *increase population w/o increasing the food* for its support. **A poor man may marry w/ little or no prospect of being able to support a family in independence** [creating more children]. They may be said therefore in some measure to create the poor which they maintain; and as the provisions of the country must, in consequence of the increased population, be distributed to every man in smaller proportions, be distributed to every man in smaller proportions, it is evident that the labour of those who are not supported by parish assistance will purchase a smaller quantity of provisions than before, and consequently, more of them must be driven to ask for support." (Ch 5, pg 39)
- wanted to abolish poor laws
	- "dependent poverty ought to be held disgraceful" (Ch 5, pg 40)
		- is it better to die w/ dignity than to lose one's honor? (see Isabelle from [[Measure for Measure]])
- does Malthus care about people?
	- prefers the benefit of society over the benefit of individuals
- *should there be a safety net for poor people?*
	- temporary? / permanent?
	- run by the church?
		- but not everyone goes to church


### Summary
Malthus set about explaining the dynamics of population and gave himself as premises that 1) food is necessary to man's existence; and 2) men and women are naturally attracted to each other. Then he says that the children that people can have is naturally limited to the available food, and when there is excess food, people are encouraged to have more children. This is especially important, because population has the potential to grow exponentially, while food production can only grow arithmetically. To counteract this, men have to either move away to find greener pastures, or let people starve. Unfortunately, it is generally the poorest of the people who suffer the most from the food shortages. At the end, Malthus took these principles and examined how they work in society at various stages of development: the savages, the shepherds, and the modern civilized peoples.
