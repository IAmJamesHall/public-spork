# Wealth of Nations
### Summary

Since people like to barter and trade, Smith argued that people tend to become more specialized in what they do, and then trade the fruits of that labor for what they actually need. Smith called this "division of labor," and he said that it makes everyone more productive because each person can focus on just their own few tasks and can become much better at their roles. And as the size of their community grows, people can become more specialized in what they focus on. Everyone can do what they are good at, and trade for what they need. Eventually, people realize that instead of directly trading goods for goods, they could trade goods for some widely recognized, permanent currency. Metals fit the bill quite nicely, and in order to make the weights and amounts of them more universal, organizations can release coins in pre-determined sizes that will be accepted everywhere.
