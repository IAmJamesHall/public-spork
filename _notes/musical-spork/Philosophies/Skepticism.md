# Skepticism


> Skepticism is a valid, and helpful thing. [[The Chastity of the Intellect]]

> Skeptical of what?
	- meta-narratives?
	- epistemology?
	- senses?
	
A skeptic is one who doubts the viability & veracity of claims


##### Greek Camps of Skepticism
- **Academic Skepticism** (can't express anything about what we know)
- **Pyrrhonic Skepticism** (can't know anything about what we know)
	- *Pyrrho lived very consistently w/ his philosophy, until he got mad at his cook for making bad food*


Skepticism started up again after the 30-yrs religious wars
- are we sure we're doing the right things? Religious knowledge just led to these horrors
- this is what [[Descartes]] was responding to

Skepticism is pretty fashionable today
	- how skeptical are today's skeptics?

**Mitigated skepticism**
	- having a different philosophy in the library vs in real life
	- we live life by habit & custom
	
[[Hume]] uses skepticism to justify his disbelief in miracles
