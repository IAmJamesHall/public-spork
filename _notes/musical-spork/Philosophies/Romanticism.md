# Romanticism

## Proponents
- [[Schopenhauer]]
- [[Hegel]]

## Lecture Notes (Dewberry)
### Introduction
- Romanticism is very difficult to define
- Not defined by its content, but a reaction to the Enlightenment
- Primarily influenced by arts & literature, but in 19th c. had profound effect on science & philosophy

### General Context
- Romanticism is against egalitarian ethics (like [[utilitarianism]]) and against the mathematical-mechanical science of the [[Enlightenment]]. Nothin aroused greater indignation among Romantics than the notion that nature was inert matter, to be understood by dissection, experiment, and analysis.
- against a natural law which wanted to blend morality with utility (egalitarianism, utilitarianism)
- Hegel is said to have captured the eessence of it with the idea of "Absolute Inwardness"
- [[Rousseau]] is usually considered the root character in this drama
	- All branches of science have their origin in vices:
		- Astronomy: superstition
		- Math: greed
		- Mechanics: ambition
- In the end, the Enlightenment through that if they collected and used all human knowledge it would lead toa  solution to all the human dilemmas. The Romantics thought they knew better


### Scientific & Philosophical Context
- After Newton it was assumed that all terrestrial and heavenly bodies operated according to the mechanical laws derived by Newton. God may have created it, but it runs on its own
	- No place for God in a purely mechanical system like [[Newton]]'s
	- Newtonian science is reductionistic. Everything is reduced to matter in motion. 
	- The scientific method is the only  way to knowledge. Empiricism combined w/ mathematics is the central feature of science. Goal is to control nature
- For the Romantics, all nature is a single living organism (World Soul). Matter is in equilibrium between two polar active opposites. It is *generating change out of itself*
	- But this change is deterministic (like Newton); a mind is involved, but it is deterministic


### Romantics Reacted against Locke's [[Epistemology]]
- John Locke is seen as the villain to romantics (b/c he started British [[Empiricism]])
	- Locke believed:
		- Humans by nature start w/ blank slate & the mind is passive. They become through experience. Change his environment & you change man
		- Very optimistic, perfectibility of man
		- No original sin
		- Move from God-centered to man-centered
		- Opened man up to social engineering

### Romantics Goal: Escape the world of appearance & enter the realm of self (real of God)
- Romantics turn against Enlightenment science
- It is the poet, not the scientist that represents the pinnacle of human knowledge. It is art not science that is the key. Rejects the Academy over public opinion.
- It is [[#The Genius]] that pushes the envelope not the mass of Bacon's democratic mass of unskilled workers
- observing nature implies understanding ourself and that understanding nature should not be obtained by force (eg disecting it or putting it in a zoo)
- Move to the Dark Side: From the Sun (Enlightenment) to the Moon (cold-hearted orb that rules the night)
	- Recognize the darkness of the human interior, not glorious & perfectible like Locke thought
	- Terrorized by a fear of God (nature)
		- Because man's darkness is God's darkness
	- Culture of feeling vs Culture of reason
		- b/c [[intuition\|intuitive]] feeling gets you to truth


### Romanticism in Philosophy
- we must emphasize emotional self-awareness to improve society (not [[Romanticism#Romantics Reacted against Locke's Epistemology\|social engineering]]) 
- centered in Germany initially
- Universe a single unified whole, not a bunch of parts (rise of ecology)
- Universe is full of values, tendencies, and life
- We know it by intuition--we are a participant--not from outside
- Nature is an experience, not an object to manipulate; once experienced, you are in tune w/ your feelings; create good & true values
- Each philosopher has their own conception of what is good and/or moral


### Individual Romantics
**[[Rousseau]]**
- noble savage, in tune w/ nature
- civilization corrupts man's wants
- seduces him from his true self
**[[Kant]]**: Transcendental Idealism
**[[Hegel]]**: most important philosopher in 19th c.
**Schopenhauer**: disagreed w/ Hegel
**Goethe**:
- disregarded Newton's theory of light
- Newton: white light is a mixture of other colors
- Goethe: prism is destroying, killing light, not understanding it
	- to understand light we nee dintuition, not mathematics
	- understand light by painting landscapes
**Marx**: Hegel applied to economics
- which does turn Hegel on his head, but hey
**German Idealists**:
- Fichte
- Schelling

### Naturphilosophie
- not reductionistic: whole
	- can't disect a creature, can only understand it as a whole
	- necessary to reunite man w/ nature
	- Biology cannot be reduced to chemistry & physics


### The Genius
-  not trying to rule; not a tyrant
- just pursuing his own project
- elevated by public opinion
- Gente (artist) was an example
