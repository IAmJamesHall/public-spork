### Class Notes
- speculative massive encompassing system
- everything is idea
- grew out of trying to complete [[Kant]] (Transcendental Idealism)
	- Kant's epistemology of the phenomena & noumena (the thing in itself); the noumena is unknowable
	- Fichte combines the phenomena & noumena; everything that exists is knowable, at least by an absolute intellect; everything is a self-expression of the World-Spirit; progress of the world is the development of this World-Spirit
- Ended w/ the Death of Hegel
