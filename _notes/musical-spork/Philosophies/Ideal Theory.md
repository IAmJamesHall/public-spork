# Ideal theory
- Everything in the mind is impressions & ideas - Hume
- Hume's skepticism is a natural result of this ^ idea.
- Ideal theory thinks that when something external is perceived, an image is passively formed in the mind.
- Reid denies that any images exist in the mind; rather, the mind is active in seeing
	- (demonstrated by experiments using optics where the brain is shown to be processing )
- believed by [[Descartes]], [[Locke]], and [[Hume]] (of course)
- the only primary quality is extension & motion
	- everything else is a secondary quality
