# Plato's Forms

**form**: an eternal archetype (or Idea) that forms the world & also stands beyond it
e.g. if something is beautiful, it is so because it "participates" in the form of Beauty

Distrust of knowledge gained by [[Sense Perception]], since perceptions are always changing, relative, private to each individual

True structure of the world is determined by intellect, not senses

Contrast between *being* and *becoming*. Forms *be*, while phenomena are in the process of *becoming*, and then perishing.

**Hierarchy of Ideas?**
Are some ideas more "real" than other ideas?
