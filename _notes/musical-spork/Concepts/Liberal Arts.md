**Why it's important**:
"If, therefore, anyone wishes to search out the truth of things in serious earnest, he ought not to select one special science; for all the sciences are conjoined with each other and interdependent: he ought rather to think how to increase the natural light of reason, not for the purpose of resolving this or that difficulty of scholastic life, but **that his understanding may light his will to its proper choice in all the contingencies of life**. In a short time he will see with amazement that he has made much more progress than those who are eager about particular ends, and that he has not only obtained all that they desire, but even higher results than fall within his expectation" - [[Descartes]], Rules for the Direction of the Mind, Rule 1 (quoted in Sophomore Math Book, pg 53)
