# Morals

**Where does morality come from?**
- leviathan makes the laws? (wrong = illegal) [[Hobbes]]
- emotions? (wrong = I feel bad)
- divinely illegal? (wrong = against God's laws; loosely, God is the leviathan)

I don't want to admit that God has authority over me and that I am fundamentally flawed. Philosophy is often a way to avoid these responsibilities.
