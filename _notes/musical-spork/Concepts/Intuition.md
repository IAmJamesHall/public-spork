# Intuition

 [[Hume]] speaks of intuitive custom being what allows us to understand cause/effect & connect ideas. (See [[Hume, Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]] and [[Reason#Is man essentially a rational animal]])
 
 Hume speaks of this custom ([[Hume, Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\|Enquiry]], Sec 6, Para 22):
 > As nature has taught us the use of our limbs, without giving us the knowledge of the muscles and nerves, by which they are actuated; so she has implanted in us an instinct, which carries forward the thought in a correspondent course to that which she has established among external objects; though we are ignorant of those powers and forces, on which this regular course and succession of objects totally depends.
