# Truth
> "What is truth" - Pontius Pilate

### Hume on Truth
#### Times He Mentioned Truth
(Taken from [[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\|Enquiry]])
- truth & falsehood exist (1.14)
- some truths are knowable (1.14)
- his goal in enquiry seems to be truth (1.17)
- Euclid found truth (4.1)
- a false thing cannot be conceived distinctly (4.2)
- implicit faith & security is the bane of all reasoining & free inquiry (and truth?) 4.3
- calls something he's demonstrated as "true" (4.8)
- waxes poetic about "love of truth" (5.1)


#### Questions & Ideas
- Is Truth = something that cooresponds with the inner workings of nature?
- So, he's trying to find truth; and he knows he can find truth regarding relations of ideas, but is he trying to find truth regarding matters of fact?
- what is truth? / what makes it true?
- what is knowledge?
	- can you have certain knowledge? about matters of fact?
