# God

##### Epistemology of God
- Ockham warned that rational philosophy cannot presume to define a being that transcends the empirically based intellect
- [[Descartes]] affirmed God's existence through reason, but was unconvincing to [[Hume]] and [[Kant]] 
- *can God be known through experience and/or reason, or can we only know (about) him through faith?*
	- maybe God is thinkable, but not knowable [[Kant]]

##### Trusting God
I may think at times that I need my computer. But I don't. I will enjoy using my computer for as long as God allows, but when he takes it away, I will not mourn it, because I know he loves me.
