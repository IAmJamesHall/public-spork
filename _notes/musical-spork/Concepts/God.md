# God

### Christian God
##### Epistemology of God
- Ockham warned that rational philosophy cannot presume to define a being that transcends the empirically based intellect
- [[Descartes]] affirmed God's existence through reason, but was unconvincing to [[Hume]] and [[Kant]] 
- *can God be known through experience and/or reason, or can we only know (about) him through faith?*
	- maybe God is thinkable, but not knowable [[Kant]]
	
	
### Greek Deities
- based in myth
- myth crossed over into history (Odyssey)
	- the gods had real impact in people's lives
- trying to understand the world; gods created order
