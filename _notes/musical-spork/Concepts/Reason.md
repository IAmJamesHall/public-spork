- Descartes makes heavy use of reason in his [[Meditations of First Philosophy]]

### Is man essentially a rational animal?
Hume places less emphasis on man's rationality, and more on intuitive custom.

Speaking of intuitive custom ([[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\|Enquiry]], Sec 6, Para 22):
> This operation of the mind, by which we infer like effects from like causes, and vice versa, is so essential to the subsistence of all human creatures, it is not probably, that it could be trusted to the fallacious deductions of our reason, which is slow in its operations; appears not, in any degree, during the first years of infancy; and at best is, in every age and period of human life, extremely liable to error and mistake.
