# Feudal System
In Middle Ages, social structure was King -> Nobles -> Knights -> Peasant.
Each class received protection and provided food for the one above it.
But eventually, the need for protection dwindled, and the lower classes were supporting the upper classes for no reason. When they realized that, things like the [[French Revolution]] started to happen.
