# Ockham's Razor
It is "sometimes inaccurately paraphrased as "the simplest explanation is usually the best one." The idea is frequently attributed to English Franciscan friar [William of Ockham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham "William of Ockham") (c. 1287â€“1347), a [[Scholasticism\|scholastic]] philosopher and theologian, although he never used these words. This [philosophical razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor "Philosophical razor") advocates that when presented with competing about the same prediction, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions, and that this is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions.""
