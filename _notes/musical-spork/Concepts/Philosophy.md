	- or can we know the physical world?

- simple principle that explains everything
- builds a whole system of how the world works


### Major Camps

		- via negativa / via positiva
- **[[Skepticism]]**

### Reasons to Believe Something
- culture says so
- I want it to be true
- that's how reality really is ( < everything *seems* to be this one )
