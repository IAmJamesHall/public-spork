### [[Reid]]'s Opinion on Language
"By language I understand all those signs which mankind use in order to communicate to others their thougths and intentions, their purposes and desires." ([[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]], pg 32)

Types of language
- 1) signs w/ no meaning except that assigned through a previous agreement (artificial)
- 2) signs that are understood by all men through the principles of nature, w/o previous agreement (natural) (ex: modulations of the voice, gestures, features)

Without a natural language, men could never have created an artificial language. 
Animals have a natural language.
