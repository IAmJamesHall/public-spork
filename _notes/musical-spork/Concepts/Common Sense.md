# Common Sense

*What is the nature of common sense?*
*Is it the same thing as [[Intuition]]?*
- can common sense contradict itself? [[#Contradictions]]


### Reid 
- Common Sense precedes [[Reason]]
- **principles of common sense**: "certain principles...which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them." ([[Inquiry & Essays]], pg 20)


### Contradictions
**Common Sense can contradict itself**
Example: If you taste a thing on one day, and then get sick and taste the same thing the next day, it will taste different. Your common sense tells you: 1) that the food hasn't changed taste; 2) that you should trust your senses; and 3) that you can trust your memory. This leads to a contradiction
