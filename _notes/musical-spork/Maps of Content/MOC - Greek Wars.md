**Super Brief Overview**: Athenians defeat Persians at sea; this gives them dominance & gives them a League behind them. They become overbearing, and spend taxes on improving their own city, and Sparta attacks. Constant warfare until plague hits Athens (hence [[Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War#Pericles' Funeral Oration\|Funeral Oration]])
