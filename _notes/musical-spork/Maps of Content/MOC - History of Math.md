##### Analysis vs Synthesis
**analysis**: "taking the thing sought as granted and proceeding by means of what follows to a truth that is uncontested"
	- example: using *x* in an equation. This is the same as granting the thing sought

**synthesis**: Stating the goal, and then making logical steps to reach the goal
	- example: Euclid's propositions. He states his goal, then takes unexplained steps to reach it, based on previous proofs.

##### Threefold Analytical Art
**zetetic**: taking a word problem and making it a formula

**poristic**

**exegetic**: taking a formula (or equation) and solving it
