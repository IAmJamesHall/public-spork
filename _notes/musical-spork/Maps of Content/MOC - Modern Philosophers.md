# Modern Philosophers 


%% Leaving the Middle Ages %%


> "Following the light of the sun, we left the Old World." - Columbus

[[Aristotle]]'s Paradigm is their background, what they are breaking free of


### New Paradigm
- starting with the Renaissance, the church is no longer the authority: **science is the authority**
- philosophy's goal is to justify the new epistemology of science
- when epistemology becomes individual, [[Skepticism]] abounds
- philosophers all asking "how do we know what's true? does science lead to truth?"



How can we have a social contract w/o becoming rule of the majority? What can a minority do?

### Rationalists vs Empiricists
#### Rationalists
- **[[Descartes]]**
	- you can know everything through intellect, not senses
	- prove things a/b soul, God
- **[[Spinoza]]**
	- few premises
	- God is the only substance
	- soul + body are not separate
- **[[Leibniz]]**
	- everything is made of monads that don't interact w/ each other
	- a pre-established harmony simulates cause/effect
	- proof for God
	- we live in the best of all possible worlds
	
#### Empiricsts
Becoming increasingly skeptical
- **[[Locke]]**
	- mind = blank slate
- **[[Berkeley]]**
	- idealist - only real things are ideas in a mind (mine or Gods)
- **[[Hume]]**
	- all ideas from impressions
	- causation - habit



### Hobbes vs Locke
##### Regarding gov
- Hobbes in favor of strong central gov
	- needs one strong Leviathan to keep all in check
- Locke would be ok with loose confederation
	- can use a sprawling society to execute justice
##### Human nature
- Hobbes
	- no morality outside state of nature
	- there is no "Natural Law" 
	- baseline is State of War
	- private property: you have a right to anything you want until you enter the social contract
- Locke
	- we discover morality through reason
	- we are naturally at State of Nature, but can move to State of War
	- private property: labor adds to an object to make it yours


### Descartes to Hume
- certainty is the golden snitch in the philosophical game of quittage
- in the medieval period, certainty was Aristotle & religious dogma, hammered in
- many thought that Descartes had caught it
- then [[Newton]] appeared to have it
- is certainty a good criterion for [[Knowledge]]?
