# Hume Term Paper
### State of the Paper

Because the original thesis now seems very uncontestable, I propose we instead discuss what he thinks of the foundation of Mathematics

  - he states that Euclid demonstrated "truths" (4.1)
  - and in Sec 4, he says that math is based on the assumption that there are inlaid laws in nature (4.13)





## Proposed Thesis

**Problem**: Towards the end of paragraph 22 of Section 5, Hume makes a statement that seems to undermine his previous arguments. He seems to say that nature has created a course among our thinking that corresponds with the course of the external objects.

> “As nature has taught us the use of our limbs, without giving us the knowledge of the muscles and nerves, by which they are actuated; so has she implanted in us an instinct, which carries forward the thought in a correspondent course to that which she has established among external objects”

**Solution**: This paper will show that this section does not actually conflict with his previous arguments. 

### Questions

- According to Reid...
  - has nature implanted a natural course among external objects?
  - can we know that our ideas of cause/effect follow that course as well?

### My Argument

- **Question**: what does he mean by "math" and how can he claim that math is true?
  - There is an underlying principle that nature has inlaid
  
  - is math true because it cooresponds to that underlying principle, or because it is internally consistent?
  
    

### Notes

- thoughts follow and are bound to impressions
- "nor can our reason, unassisted by experience, ever draw any inference concerning real existence and matter of fact"
- can't extrapolate past experience to future predictions???
- the ultimate things that run the phaenomena are undiscoverable (pg 112, 4.12)
- he really emphasizes our inability to know cause/effect through reason; only through experience
- there are really principles behind the phaenomena (e.g. something is nutritious to eat, and we can discover that, but we can't discover why) 4.16
  - we assume that similar qualities are always accompanied by similar secret powers (principles) (5.4) by **custom of habit** 
- arguments from experience can only be probable (4.19)
- experience = "the great guide of human life" (4.20)
- reason is incapable of drawing from a thousand examples something that it coulnd't draw from one example; **custom** can do that
  - so, inferences from experience are custom, not reason
- "All belief of matter of fact or real existence is derived merely from some object, present to the memory or senses, and a customary conjunction between that and some other object." (5.8)
  - can we actually learn anything of history? (5.7)
- there really is a defined course in nature, and our succession of ideas matches with it.
