title: Great Conversation

> "You come late. When you arrive, others have long preceded you, and they are engaged in a heated discussion, a discussion too heated for them to pause and tell you exactly what it is about … You listen for a while, until you decide that you have caught the tenor of the argument; then you put in your oar. Someone answers you; you answer him; another comes to your defense; another aligns himself against you … The hour grows late, you must depart. And you do depart, with the discussion still vigorously in progress." –The Philosophy of Literary Form, Kenneth Burke.
