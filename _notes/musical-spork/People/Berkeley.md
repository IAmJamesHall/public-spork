### Bkgrd Info
- 1685-1753
- bishop in the Irish church
	- Mission to the Americas

### Epistemology
- idealist - denied the possibility of inert, mindless, material substance.
- core idea: for something to exist it has to be perceived by the active being that does the perceiving.
	- "if a tree falls in the forest where noone hears it, does it make a sound?"
	- since everything is in the mind, if it's not perceived it doesn't exist
- What is the resemblance to matter? Only an idea resembles an idea. 
- Therefore, we must be skeptical about the material world
- **Everything is an idea in the mind of God**
