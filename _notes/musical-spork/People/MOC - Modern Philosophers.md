# Modern Philosophers 


%% Leaving the Middle Ages %%


> "Following the light of the sun, we left the Old World." - Columbus

[[Aristotle]]'s Paradigm is their background, what they are breaking free of


### New Paradigm
- the church is no longer the authority: **science is the authority**
- philosophy's goal is to justify the new epistemology of science
- when epistemology becomes individual, [[Skepticism]] abounds
- philosophers all asking "how do we know what's true? does science lead to truth?"



How can we have a social contract w/o becoming rule of the majority? What can a minority do?

### Hobbes vs Locke
##### Regarding gov
- Hobbes in favor of strong central gov
	- needs one strong Leviathan to keep all in check
- Locke would be ok with loose confederation
	- can use a sprawling society to execute justice
##### Human nature
- Hobbes
	- no morality outside state of nature
	- there is no "Natural Law" 
	- baseline is State of War
	- private property: you have a right to anything you want until you enter the social contract
- Locke
	- we discover morality through reason
	- we are naturally at State of Nature, but can move to State of War
	- private property: labor adds to an object to make it yours
