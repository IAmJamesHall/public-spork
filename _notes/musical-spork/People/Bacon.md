# Francis Bacon

### Summary of *Novum Organum*
Bacon saw that science was being held back by ignorance and mental blocks. Enumerating some of these mental blocks, he included: the four kinds of idols, man's tendency to color his reason with his desires, the philosophies of the ancients, and the apparent necessity for science to be practical. These mental blocks had come into place because of the lack of human intelligence focused on this problem. Rarely in history has there been dedicated mental effort working for the improvement of natural science that would have identified these blocks. Bacon said that he was one of the first to do so. As the result of his work, Bacon proposed a new method of science which goes from sensory observations to very specific axioms, and then moves slowly up through middle axioms to general axioms. Instead of letting his intellect run wild, he proposed to regulate it with the information from the senses.
