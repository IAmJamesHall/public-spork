### Notes
- actors - same status as vagrants, prostitutes
	- so playing groups had to be attached to a vouching nobleman, or they'd be whipped
- Mystery plays - annual; morality plays
- "liberties" - plots of land in London that were free from the city's laws (b/c they used to house monasteries, etc)
- 8 playwrights in London (University Wits) debauched, but couldn't tempt S., so they disliked him
	- because Shakespeare wouldn't be debauched, he outlasted them
