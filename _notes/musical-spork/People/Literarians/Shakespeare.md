### Notes
- actors - same status as vagrants, prostitutes
	- so playing groups had to be attached to a vouching nobleman, or they'd be whipped
- Mystery plays - annual; morality plays
- "liberties" - plots of land in London that were free from the city's laws (b/c they used to house monasteries, etc)
- 8 playwrights in London (University Wits) debauched, but couldn't tempt S., so they disliked him
	- because Shakespeare wouldn't be debauched, he outlasted them
- humanizes minorities
	- Jews (Shylock, "if you prick us, do we not bleed?")
	- women (Portia, saves the day; Isabella, moral compass of [[Shakespeare, Measure for Measure]])
- monarchist
	- plays are in favor of the [[Great Chain of Being]]
	- anytime the appropriate order/structure is disrupted, things go bad
	- Leer (abdication of responsibility), Romeo & Juliet (insubordinate to authority)
- coming out of the Medieval worldview, with a protestant flair
	- renaissance influenced, stories drawn from Greeks & Romans
	- a literary innovator, but not a religious or political one
