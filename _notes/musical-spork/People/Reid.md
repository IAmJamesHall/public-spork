# Thomas Reid

### Bkgrd info
- 1710-1796
- Scottish common sense philosopher
- Presbyterian minister


### Philosophy
- We know a lot (from our senses)
- Common sense principles (like that I exist) are assumptions that are necessary to know anything
- Rejecting common sense principles lead to a blank slate and lunacy
- Senses are like a language that speaks to us.
- Our rationality coincides with the rationality of nature. God built us that way
- We're not aware of "sensations", only the things in the real world
