### Influence
- contributed to decline of church authority
	- "Unless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear reason (for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone, since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not retract anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience" - Luther
	- "For what purpose does it serve to raise a new dispute about matters condemned through so many centuries by church and council? Unless perhaps a reason must be given to just anyone about anything whatsoever. But if it were granted that whoever contradicts the councils and the common understanding of the church must be overcome by Scripture passages, we will have nothing in Christianity which is certain or decided." (imperial secretary Johann Eck [not the same Eck])
- authority of conscience or church?

### Summary of *Freedom of a Christian*
Luther begins his treatise with an introductory letter to the Pope, hoping to convince him that Luther was not his enemy. Then Luther began his main subject: the place of faith and works. He argued that there are two parts of a Christian: the inner and the outer, the spirit and the body. The most important thing for a Christian to do is to become firmly rooted in the Word of God and to have faith in Him. This is done by the spirit, and it is what saves a person. No work of the body can save anyone. And yet, works are not unimportant. While faith will bring a man's soul into harmony with God, his body will still be in rebellion against God. Thus, works are useful for training the body to obey God. Works should be done to serve God and others, but not to try to benefit oneself.
