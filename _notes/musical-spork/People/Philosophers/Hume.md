### Bkgrd Info
- 1711-1776
- Scottish
- studied law at 15, did not like it
- self-taught in philosophy
- published "Treatise of Human Understanding" at age 28
	- thought it would make him a rock star like Newton.
	- received little attention
	- [[Reid]] & [[Kant]] were the only philosophers who took him seriously



### His Philosophy
#### What was in the air
1. the rationalism and deduction of [[Descartes]]
2. [[Newton]] - test experimentally
3. [[Empiricism]]
4. Relgious wars
5. [[Skepticism]]

Hume tells us he is applying Newton experimental method to the mind

What does Hume think [[Reason]] is?


#### Cause & Effect
There may be cause & effect, but we can't know what it is or if it is.


#### First Principles
Everything in the mind is either impressions or ideas.
- "All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds, which I shall call impressions and ideas." - first sentence of Hume's Treatise
- idea is just a copy of the impression
- we can make assocations/operations on ideas (math)



#### Bringing Ideal Theory to its logical conclusions
- impressions and ideas are the only thing that exists in the mind
- constant conjunction
	- I have experienced these things together in the past, so I expect them together in the future
	- "after the constant conjunction of two objects, heat and flame, for instance...we are determined by custom alone to expect the one from the appearance fo the other." -Ch 5, para 5 [[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]
	- works well for ordinary life, but not so well for extraordinary things like [[Miracles]]
- cause & effect are only in the mind
	- there is some underlying, unknowable force that is behind the cause/effect
- cause & effect are not based in reason; we only know them through experience of constant conjunction (senses, memory)
- [[Solipsism]]
- philosophy is not useful for living life
	- custom & habit is how we live life (social experience)
- Hume couldn't say that because there is a creation, there must be a creator
	- I didn't sense the creation of it, so I can't assume that it happened
- very empericist
	- every idea must come from an impression
- Hume downplays the impact of his position


#### Math
