# Pre-Socratics

### Starting to begin Philosophizing
- moving away from myth toward [[Philosophy]]
	- Upanishads, atman, Brahma
	- contemplation
	- Homer
		- what moves heroes? not cosmos
		- best course - pay homage to gods
	- reason is more powerful than religion
- goal of Philosophy
	- solve practical problems (begin, sustain, defend)
	- build power & wealth to pursue
	- personal gods -> impersonal gods
	- chaos -> cosmos
	- find the *arche*


### Why Were the Greeks the Ones who Started Philosophizing?
- estranged from the world - here alone
- trade w/ people w/ very different ideas
- they want to understand the world
- no final authority on truth
