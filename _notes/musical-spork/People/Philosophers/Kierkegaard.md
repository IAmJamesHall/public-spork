# Kierkegaard
### Notes
- took Hegel's historical progress model and applied that to people
	- Parts of a life
		- aesthetic - devoted to the things around you
		- ethical - rule following
		- religious - existentially committed to the infinite
	- life is about dealing w/ internal contradictions in yourself
	- inwardness - who you are underneath the external layers that others see
		- critizing the very superficial state church of Denmark
