### Philosophy
- We know a lot (from our senses)
- Common sense principles (like that I exist) are assumptions that are necessary to know anything (if you reject; leads to lunacy)
- Senses are like a language that speaks to us.
- Our rationality coincides with the rationality of nature. God built us that way
- We're not aware of "sensations", only the things in the real world
	- horse -> driftwood
- *Is Reid a skeptic?*

### What is he doing?
- analyses [[Descartes]], [[Locke]], and Malebranche & thinks they've done a bad job of proving the world's existence
- [[Skepticism]] is ridiculous
- Believes in [[Common Sense]]
