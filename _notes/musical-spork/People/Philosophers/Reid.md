### Philosophy
- We know a lot (from our senses)
- Common sense principles (like that I exist) are assumptions that are necessary to know anything (if you reject; leads to lunacy)
- Senses are like a language that speaks to us.
- Our rationality coincides with the rationality of nature. God built us that way
- We're not aware of "sensations", only the things in the real world
