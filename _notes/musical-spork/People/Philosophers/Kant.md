# Kant
Wrote [[Kant, What is Enlightenment?]]
*Man's primary problem isn't sin; it's that he doesn't have the freedom to reason & be enlightened (??)*

### Background
- came from Prussia, wrote under Frederick the Great
- Kant - a rationalist who wants to confine reason to the bounds of experience
	- reason is bound by the condition of possible experience; cannot reason about unexperienced things
	- so, we can't reason a/b God crating the world because we didn't experience it
- believes ethics to be duty to rules
- enamored with Liebniz until he read [[Hume]]; found Liebniz to be incomplete
- what is the nature of reason & what can/can not be done w/ it
- Trying to defend science
	- If [[Newton]] is right, then everything is determined. So there must be some underlying noumena below the phenomena
	- but we also can't talk a/b noumena
	- if we don't assume the existence of a rational [[God]] who made a rational universe, why would we assume that our mind can coorespond to reality? All we can know is that it works for us.
- developed transcendental realism
	- experience is understood through & affected by reason
- key player in [[Enlightenment]]


### Major Works
- Epistemology & Metaphysics
	- Critique of Pure Reason (First Critique) (1781)
	- Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783)
- Ethics
	- Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785)
	- Critique of Practical Reason (Second Critique) (1788)
- Aesthetics & Teleology
	- Critique of the Power of Judgement (Third Critique) (1790)

### Some terms
- **A posteriori** - based in experience
- **A priori** - not based in experience
- **Analytic** statement - predicate is logically contained in the subject (primarily definitions & tautologies; e.g. a bachelor is an unmarried man)
- **Synthetic** statement - predicate adds to the knowledge of the subject (most statements; e.g. cats have 4 legs)
- **Transcendental Argument**:
	- Establish X as the necessary conditions for the possibility of Y
	- Then, since Y exists, X must be the case
- **Phenomena** - things as I experience them, appearances of things
- **Noumena** - things as they are in themselves (we cannot know noumena, we can only say that they exist)
	- *but if we can't experience these, why should we say they exist?*
- The **Categorical Imperative** - Kant's moral principle (internal reason; not external authority)
	- Act only in ways that everyone could act, ways that don't make exceptions for yourself
	- Or, respect the rationality or others, their ability to set their own goals

### Questions
- can we make synthetic, a priori statements?
	- we can, so our mind has to be filling in / providing experience on its own (e.g. causation)


### Kant's "Copernican Revolution"
"Previously it has been assumed that all of our cognition must conform itself to objects… Let us now, therefore, test whether we do not make better progress on the problems of metaphysics by assuming that objects must conform themselves to our cognition… Matters stand here just as they did for the first thoughts of Copernicus, who, when things did not go well for explaining the celestial motions if he assumed that the entire host of stars rotates about the observer, sought to find whether things might not go better if the had the observer rotate, and by contrast left the stars at rest."" (Critique of Pure Reason)
