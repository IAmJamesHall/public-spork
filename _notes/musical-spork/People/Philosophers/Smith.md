(Also wrote Theory of Moral Sentiments (based on [[Hume]]) in 1759)

Smith was a moral philosopher
Non-Christian, close friend of [[Hume]]

"The [[Smith, Wealth of Nations]] is a very violent attack upon the whole commercial system of Great Britain." - Smith
- it was descriptive of England's economics, not prescriptive
- from the perspective of the wealth of a nation, joint-stock co is not the best model
First one to do the science of economics (part of the [[Enlightenment]] push toward science)
- first thought of economics in terms of wages, rent, & profit (GDP/capita)
	- the bigger the #, the more fulfilled you are fulfilled

In savage nations, people work hard, but are so poor they sometimes have to kill off their relatives. But in civilized nations, a lot of people don't work, and consume a lot, but even a poor workman can provide for himself. (paraphrased from intro, pg LX)
