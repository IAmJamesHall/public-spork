Wrote: [[Hegel, Intro to Philosophy of History\|Intro to Philosophy of History]]

### Notes
- absolute idealist
-  key member of [[German Idealism]]
- student of Fichte & relied on him in his work
- the great intellect is not personal & is accessible to man b/c man's intellect is an extension of its intellect
- view of history
	- teleological development - development in a direction ([[Darwin]] takes this and runs w/ it)
	- history recognizes internal contradictions and seeks to fix them
		- e.g. in America, all men are free, but there were also slaves; history then corrected that contradiction
	- the better-developed the World-Spirit is, the more freely it can act
- substitutes reason for religion 
	- [[Kierkegaard]] critizes him for rationalizing religions existential parts


### Later 
- Young Hegelians
	- reason & freedom, keep them guiding forward
	- ditched Hegel's politics & religion
	- [[Feuerbach]], [[Marx]]
- Right Hegelians
	- develop Hegel's political statism
	- Germany has reached the top, so now we conserve it
	- but still insist on a personal God
	- its different eras affected the development of Christianity
