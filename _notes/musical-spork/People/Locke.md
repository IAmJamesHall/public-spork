3. Ideas resemble real existences
4. Essence of the mind not thinking - sometimes we don't think
5. All ideas from sensation or reflection
6. Body & mind united, and there is a real external world that we sense (Corpuscular)
7. Simple & complex ideas
	1. simple ideas are individual qualities (red, sweet, shape)
8. complex ideas are combined simple ideas (apple)
9. Memory & personal identity
