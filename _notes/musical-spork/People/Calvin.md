# John Calvin


### Summary of *Institutes* (excerpt)
Calvin wrote to the King of France to explain his beliefs and plead his cause. Calvin had been slandered by his enemies and wished that the king would know the truth. 

The two primary doctrines he argued in this passage were election and reprobation. He first explained the difference between foreknowledge and predestination, where God sees everything in time as though it were in the present, and also where God sets in motion every action he wishes man to do. Some men were created for eternal life (election), while others were created solely for destruction (reprobation). Calvin spent some significant time arguing that God is not unjust in planning out a man's evil and then punishing him for it. One of his main arguments was that since God is the all-powerful creator, it is not unjust for him to do as he pleases.
