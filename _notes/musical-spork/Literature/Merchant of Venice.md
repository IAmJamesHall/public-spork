# Merchant of Venice


### Summary
Bassanio wishes to try his hand at wooing Portia, but he has no money for it. He asks his friend Antonio for a loan. Since Antonio does not have cash on hand (though he does have ships at sea that will arrive soon), he borrows money from a Jew, Shylock. Shylock agrees to the loan on the stipulation that he get a pound of flesh if Antonio defaults. Bassanio takes the money and wins Portia's hand, but Antonio receives word that his ships foundered at sea and he now has no way to pay back Shylock. And since Shylock holds a grudge against Antonio, Shylock insists on his pound of flesh, even though others offer twice as much money in Antonio's defence. Then Portia (in disguise) comes and defends Antonio, allowing Shylock his pound of flesh only if he does not take any blood as well. Shylock then admits defeat.
