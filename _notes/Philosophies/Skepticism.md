# Skepticism


> Skepticism is a valid, and helpful thing. [[The Chastity of the Intellect]]

> Skeptical of what?
	- meta-narratives?
	- epistemology?
	- senses?


##### Greek Camps of Skepticism
- **Academic Skepticism** (can't express anything about what we know)
- **Pyrrhonic Skepticism** (can't know anything about what we know)
	- *Pyrrho lived very consistently w/ his philosophy, until he got mad at his cook for making bad food*


- Skepticism started up again after the 30-yrs religious wars
	- this is what [[Descartes]] was responding to
