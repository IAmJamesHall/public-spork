# Aristotle


### Aristotle's Paradigm (Middle Ages bkgrd)
- Matter is eternal and exists w/o forms
- Forms only exist with matter
- No sensations, no imagination, no intellect w/o forms, phantasms, or species in the mind
- Impressions on a passive mind 
	- impressions are the things we see, sense
- Active intellect perceives passive intellect
- **We know nothing about a body or its qualities, but as far as we have sensations which resemble those qualities.**
- Our sensations are the impressions which sensible objects make upon the mind. ([[Sense Perception]])
	- Like seal on wax
	- Impression is the image or **form** of the soul, without matter in it.
	- Impressions must resemble the things from which they are taken
	- Every sensation is the image or form of some sensible qualities of the object
- Aristotle assumes that bodies and qualities of bodies exist. He infers the nature of sensation.


### Four Causes
*originative sources*
(with the example of a chair)
1. Material - stuff it's made of (boards)
2. Formal - pattern, form, plan (blueprint, schematic)
3. Final - purpose, τέλος (desire to sit)
4. Efficient - steps by which it comes into being (hammering, sawing)


### Two Types of Philosophy

- **Practical** Philosophy (moral virtues / dispositions, practice in affairs)
	- goal is to *become more moral*
- **Theoretical** Philosophy (devoted to intellectual matters, [matter, form, motion])
	- goal is to *find more knowledge*
	- types of study (theology & physics are guess-work; *math brings truth*):
		- **theology**: invisible motionless deity, separated from perceptible reality, can only be imagined
		- **mathematics**: form + motion, shape, number; with or w/o senses, attribute of everything
		- **physics**: material, motion, qualities, sub-lunar, corruptible, senses, mortal


### Pathway to Knowledge
Sense -> Intuition of form -> First principles -> Math -> Scientific Knowledge (Demonstrable)
