		- “More than that, I am aware that the principal reason which causes many impious persons not to desire to believe that **there is a God**, and that **the human soul is distinct from the body**, is that they declare that hitherto **no one has been able to demonstrate these two facts**…”
		- “For the truth itself will easily cause all men of mind and learning to subscribe to your judgment; and your authority will cause the atheists, who are usually more arrogant than learned or judicious, to rid themselves of their spirit of contradiction or lead them possibly themselves to defend the reasonings which they find being receives as demonstrations by all persons of consideration, lest they appear not to understand them. And, finally, all others will easily yield to such a mass of evidence, and there will be none who dares to doubt the existence of God and the real and true distinction between the human soul and the body.” (Descartes, Cambridge, 3)
