# Modern Philosophers 
## Leaving the Middle Ages


> "Following the light of the sun, we left the Old World." - Columbus

[[Aristotle]]'s Paradigm is their background, what they are breaking free of


### New Paradigm
- the church is no longer the authority: **science is the authority**
- philosophy's goal is to justify the new epistemology of science
- when epistemology becomes individual, [[Skepticism]] abounds
- philosophers all asking "how do we know what's true? does science lead to truth?"



### Timeline of Philosophers

- [[Descartes]] (1596-1650) - claims to make a whole new start in philosophy
- [[Locke]] (1632-1704) - not starting from a model, build a framework by inducting from the senses
- [[Berkeley]] (1685-1753) - writing against material science; everything an idea in the mind of God
- [[Hume]] (1711-1776) - took ideal theory to its logical conclusion
- [[Reid]] (1710 - 1796) - common sense philosopher who responded to ideal theory
